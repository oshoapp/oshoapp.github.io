# About OSHOApp

OSHOApp is a simple, modern platform crafted by [Extreme_Krish](https://github.com/ExtremeKrish) to make Osho's Hindi and English discourses accessible through an advanced, user-friendly reader. Tired of navigating outdated and clunky Osho websites, I built this as a passion project to provide a seamless experience for enthusiasts.

Our advanced reader offers a clean interface, fast navigation, and a distraction-free environment to dive deep into Osho's teachings. The site is non-profit, created purely for fun and to share knowledge. Content is sourced from publicly available discourses under fair use, and weâ€™ll promptly comply with any takedown requests from rights owners.
